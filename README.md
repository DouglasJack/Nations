# Nations

This fork is my idea of how a "war" system should work. This is simply a tool that allows players to revoke eachothers claims over their land. /n war *nation name* will ask both nations to agree to war with no consequences. I'm not updating readme again so in the future I may work towards adding /n instantwar *nation name* which will partially depleate the command executors nation bank and double their upkeep costs.
