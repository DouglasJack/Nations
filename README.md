By Aires:
Adding a rent system to this plugin totally separated from taxes, to either player nations or admin nations zones.
Adding a zone balance to automatically pay rents, zone balances are not used when zone is bought.
Also adding a cosmetic thing: nations and zones display names, separated from the nation real name which works as id, the display name can be larger and is also configured the min and max size.
